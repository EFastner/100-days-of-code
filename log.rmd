# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Time:** 120 Minutes (8:30 PM - 10:30 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Forked and Modified the 100 Days of Code resources to fit my needs. Split my previous Lock Line Analysis into it's own repository via [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/)

**Thoughts:** Lots of misc items completed that I've been putting off for awhile, I almost pushed the start of this until tomorrow. Ultimately, it was still a really positive 2 hours!

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Time:** 120 Minutes (10:00 PM - 12:00 AM)

**Today's Progress:** Converted lock line vizualization script into a function, branched the file via [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging), and re-merged with the master branch

**Thoughts:** I need to get more comfortable with branching, but we'll get there. The foundations for this function may be fun to ultimately load into some sort of Shiny app. The code is becoming a lot more flexible

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Time:** 90 Minutes (8:15 PM - 9:45 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Experimented with the RPostgreSQL package in R to learn how to interact with PostgreSQL. Utilized an [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/getting-started-with-postgresql-in-r/) tutorial to get started. 

**Thoughts:** This was a big confidence boost. I've been a little intimidated about getting this set up, but it was WAY easier than I thought it would be. Glad I have this challenge to make me sit down and figure some of this out
