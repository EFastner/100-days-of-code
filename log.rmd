# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Time:** 120 Minutes (8:30 PM - 10:30 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Forked and Modified the 100 Days of Code resources to fit my needs. Split my previous Lock Line Analysis into it's own repository via [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/)

**Thoughts:** Lots of misc items completed that I've been putting off for awhile, I almost pushed the start of this until tomorrow. Ultimately, it was still a really positive 2 hours!
