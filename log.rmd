# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Time:** 120 Minutes (8:30 PM - 10:30 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Forked and Modified the 100 Days of Code resources to fit my needs. Split my previous Lock Line Analysis into it's own repository via [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/)

**Thoughts:** Lots of misc items completed that I've been putting off for awhile, I almost pushed the start of this until tomorrow. Ultimately, it was still a really positive 2 hours!

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Time:** 120 Minutes (10:00 PM - 12:00 AM)

**Today's Progress:** Converted lock line vizualization script into a function, branched the file via [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging), and re-merged with the master branch

**Thoughts:** I need to get more comfortable with branching, but we'll get there. The foundations for this function may be fun to ultimately load into some sort of Shiny app. The code is becoming a lot more flexible

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Time:** 90 Minutes (8:15 PM - 9:45 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Experimented with the RPostgreSQL package in R to learn how to interact with PostgreSQL. Utilized an [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/getting-started-with-postgresql-in-r/) tutorial to get started. 

**Thoughts:** This was a big confidence boost. I've been a little intimidated about getting this set up, but it was WAY easier than I thought it would be. Glad I have this challenge to make me sit down and figure some of this out

### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Time:** 60 Minutes (7:30 PM - 8:30 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Kind of a light day. Didn't get a lot done. Played around with the RPostgreSQL commands to begin creating and populating tables via RStudio

**Thoughts:** Mostly exploratory, should come in handy for Day 5

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Time:** >150 Minutes (Off and on from 10 AM - 4:00 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Created and populated tables with game results by season from 2007 - 2018, a table with the same data organized by team, and a table with each individual skater's stats going back to 2007. Updated some old summary functions as well

**Thoughts:** Lots of work to do! I need to stop reusing the table creation and populating functions for specific tables. Either I need to make them more flexible, or I need to start creating separate functions for each new table. The game summary and skater summary functions could also use some extra documentation/streamlining. Maybe this would be a good time to start inplementing some unit testing?

### Day 6: January 6, 2019

**Time:** >90 Minutes (8:30pm to 10pm)

**Today's Progress:** Played around with twitteR package on CRAN. Used instructions from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/access-data-from-twitter-api-using-r-and-or-python-b8ac342d3efe) to get started

**Thoughts:** Frustrating day. I started out by just experimenting with the twitteR package and ultimately pulled all off Lin Manuel Miranda's "Gmorning" and "Gnight" tweets, however the function seems to only pull the truncated version of tweets when they are over 140 characters. I spent a lot of time trying to find a solution, but up until this point I've come up short. Other options would be to switch over to the rtweet package, or to just pull the API myself. I sort of like the latter, as I don't have much experience with APIs.

### Day 7: January 7, 2019

**Time:** >90 Minutes (7:30pm to 9:00pm)

**Today's Progress:** Experimented more with RPostgreSQL, created some new tables, and set up some functions to make basic queries. These should come in handy for pulling data across seasons. One of the issues that I used to have was reading multiple seasons into memory from multiple .csv files and then filtering out what I needed. Now I should be able to just query the filtered data straight from the SQL tables as needed.

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited about where this is going. I added in the tables with draft years, which means I can hopefully use this code to query data by game for each player

### Day 8: January 8, 2019

**Time:** 60 Minutes (5:15pm to 6:15pm)

**Today's Progress:** Revisited some of the game summary functions that I created back when I first started with the Tidyverse. Lot's to clean up

**Thoughts:** Some of the sins of my past came back to haunt me. I spent a lot of time just jumping from function to function trying to figure out what format data frames needed to be in, what I was missing, etc. Lots of opportunity to clean this up in the future, may implement some unit testing?

### Day 9: January 9, 2019

**Time:** 60 Minutes (10:45pm to 11:45pm)

**Today's Progress:** Started to learn how to design a Shiny App using this [tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/). Got through the first 8 sections and now need to implement some server logic

**Thoughts:** This was a whole lot of fun! Shiny apps seem a lot easier than I thought, I think it may be possible to implement this with the lock line analysis that I did earlier than I thought
