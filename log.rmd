# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Time:** 120 Minutes (8:30 PM - 10:30 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Forked and Modified the 100 Days of Code resources to fit my needs. Split my previous Lock Line Analysis into it's own repository via [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/)

**Thoughts:** Lots of misc items completed that I've been putting off for awhile, I almost pushed the start of this until tomorrow. Ultimately, it was still a really positive 2 hours!

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Time:** 120 Minutes (10:00 PM - 12:00 AM)

**Today's Progress:** Converted lock line vizualization script into a function, branched the file via [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging), and re-merged with the master branch

**Thoughts:** I need to get more comfortable with branching, but we'll get there. The foundations for this function may be fun to ultimately load into some sort of Shiny app. The code is becoming a lot more flexible

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Time:** 90 Minutes (8:15 PM - 9:45 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Experimented with the RPostgreSQL package in R to learn how to interact with PostgreSQL. Utilized an [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/getting-started-with-postgresql-in-r/) tutorial to get started. 

**Thoughts:** This was a big confidence boost. I've been a little intimidated about getting this set up, but it was WAY easier than I thought it would be. Glad I have this challenge to make me sit down and figure some of this out

### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Time:** 60 Minutes (7:30 PM - 8:30 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Kind of a light day. Didn't get a lot done. Played around with the RPostgreSQL commands to begin creating and populating tables via RStudio

**Thoughts:** Mostly exploratory, should come in handy for Day 5

### Day 5: January 5, 2019

**Time:** >150 Minutes (Off and on from 10 AM - 4:00 PM)

**Today's Progress:** Created and populated tables with game results by season from 2007 - 2018, a table with the same data organized by team, and a table with each individual skater's stats going back to 2007. Updated some old summary functions as well

**Thoughts:** Lots of work to do! I need to stop reusing the table creation and populating functions for specific tables. Either I need to make them more flexible, or I need to start creating separate functions for each new table. The game summary and skater summary functions could also use some extra documentation/streamlining. Maybe this would be a good time to start inplementing some unit testing?
